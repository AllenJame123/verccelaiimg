        <p>Master these typography fundamentals with these logo design tips for beginners:</p>
        <p><strong>Choose Appropriate Fonts:</strong> Select typefaces that match your brand personality. Serif fonts suggest tradition and reliability, while sans-serif fonts appear modern and clean.</p>
